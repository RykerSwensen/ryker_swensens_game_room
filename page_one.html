      <h4>Upon starting Red Dead Redemption 2, you learn that you are a bad person in a gang of bad people running from another gang of bad people. It is a slow beginning. A long horse ride of listening to dialog. While this game does have epic western action moments, it is the long slow dialog moments that make this game. If you are not a fan of slower story based games, this 70 hour game is not for you.</h4>
      <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is a story of a man who was raised by a gang of outlaws. Arthur Morgan. Arthur is not the most interesting character. Arthur is slow, funny, and not too bright. However, it is the lessons you learn as the story progresses with Arthur. </p>
      <p>I watched the choices I made affect people in negative ways. Widowed wives, people struggling with money, and people who were wronged. I watched Arthur pay the price and consequence of making bad decisions. It was so powerful and so beautiful It is the single greatest story I have ever been told.</p>
      <p>What made Red Dead Redemption 2 such an important game to me, was all the emotions it made me feel throughout the game. You start off thinking you are an outlaw. I played recklessly and without care. I didn't care who or whom I would hurt along the way. However, I learned to love some of the characters I interacted with throughout my 90-hour playthrough. I also learned to hate some characters along the way too. I watched people I spent tens of hours with turn on me, succumb to greed and power. I watched Arthur fall sick and learn he did not have much time left. As soon as Arthur learned of his sickness, the game changed completlely for me.</p>
